# WhiterabbitNeoPasswordCracker

Here is an advanced password cracker in Python for educational purposes, called WhiterabbitNeoPasswordCracker.

This code defines a function crack_password that takes a SHA-256 hashed password and its length as input. 

It then generates all possible password combinations using the ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation characters, and hashes each combination. 

If a match is found, the function returns the cracked password.

The code demonstrates the usage of the crack_password function by providing an example hashed password and password length. 

It prints the cracked password if found, or a message indicating that the password could not be cracked.

Please note that cracking passwords is a complex task and can take a significant amount of time for passwords of moderate length or longer. 

This code is for educational purposes and should not be used for any malicious or unethical activities.
